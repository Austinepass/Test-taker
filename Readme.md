# Test taker
Previously a simple app I built at the early stages of my Android development journey, allowed users to take quiz questions on Verbal, Quantitative, and Abstract Reasoning as shown below.

Now the application has been fully revamped to leverage the Gemini AI capabilities and provide a much richer user experience while maintaining a minimalist user interface.
The idea is simple yet powerful. It allows users to generate quiz questions from literally any topic or field with just a single prompt.
